# Prerequisites For Using OpenShift V3 as a User (Web Developer)

For the first draft of this document we are going to focus getting this all going on Fedora 20/21 
because that is the main OS for the doc author. In the future this will be expanded for Mac and Windows.

## You need to install the following on your machine:

1. VirtualBox - Here are the links to VirtualBox installations for Fedora, Mac, Windows, and Ubuntu
2. Vagrant - Here is the link to the installer for all the same platforms as VirtualBox
3. Ruby and Ruby Gems - here is the instructions to install this on Fedora

Once those are all set you can move on to using Vagrant to spin up a VirtualBox image with everything
you need already installed. By the end we will have OpenShift V3 running in a guest virtual machine and be
able to connect to it from your host machine. We will be using the OpenShift command line tools to do all
our work from our host machine
