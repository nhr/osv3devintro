# Prerequisites For Using OpenShift V3 as a User (Web Developer)

For the first draft of this document we are going to focus getting this all going on Fedora 20/21 
because that is the main OS for the doc author. In the future this will be expanded for Mac and Windows.

Please be aware that we are going to make some modifications that might have security and networking changes. 
We do not recommend this tutorial for people who are inexperienced with Linux systems or afraid to get their
hands a little dirty. I did all of these steps to my own work machine and so they have been tested 
on Fedora 20 with the latest updates. I would love github issues or pull requests for any errors you experience.

## You need to install the following on your machine:

1. https://docs.docker.com/installation/fedora/[Install Docker] - Not only are you going to use Docker images to 
deploy your application but we are going to run OpenShift in Docker (I think that is nifty)

*I used* 

  $ docker --version
  Docker version 1.4.1, build 5bc2ff8/1.4.1
  

2. To get OpenShift to be able to deploy domain names and see them on our host machine we need a way to handle DNS 
without adding a DNS server. So we also need to set up *dnsmasq*

3. We are 



Once those are all set you can move on to using Vagrant to spin up a VirtualBox image with everything
you need already installed. By the end we will have OpenShift V3 running in a guest virtual machine and be
able to connect to it from your host machine. We will be using the OpenShift command line tools to do all
our work from our host machine
