# Prerequisites For Using OpenShift V3 as a User (Web Developer)

For the first draft of this document we are going to focus getting this all going on Fedora 20/21 
because that is the main OS for the doc author. In the future this will be expanded for Mac and Windows.

Please be aware that we are going to make some modifications that might have security and networking changes. 
We do not recommend this tutorial for people who are inexperienced with Linux systems or afraid to get their
hands a little dirty. I did all of these steps to my own work machine and so they have been tested 
on Fedora 20 with the latest updates. I would love github issues or pull requests for any errors you experience.

## You need to install the following on your machine:

1. https://docs.docker.com/installation/fedora/[Install Docker] - Not only are you going to use Docker images to

  $ docker --version
  Docker version 1.4.1, build 5bc2ff8/1.4.1
  

**Right now I am thinking all this is not needed and will revist**
2. To get OpenShift to be able to deploy domain names and see them on our host machine we need a way to handle DNS 
without adding a DNS server. So we also need to set up *dnsmasq*. Please note I have not set this up before and I am 
assuming the same on your machine. If you have already changed your *dnsmasq* configuration then please proceed
carefully.

Before you click that link:

  a. I chose to just add the contents of the **dnsmasq.conf** in the repository to the top of my current
  **dnsmasq.conf**

  b. For me adding the contents to my **/etc/hosts** was the same as just appending the last 3 lines of the file
  the repo to the end of my current **/etc/hosts**
  
3. We are
